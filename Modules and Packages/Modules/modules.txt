We use modules to manage our code in a proper way by dividing each block or group of blocks
into different python files and then importing them when needed.
This makes our code easy to manage and easy to reuse our code in different python files.

There are 2 different ways to Import a python file
1) Importing the whole python file
2) Importing a particular function from a python file

Syntax of both methods:
1) import "Python File Name"
2) from "Python File Name" import "Function/Method Name"
