We use classes to define new types
We Have already learnt about inbuilt types like Numbers, Strings, Boolean.
We also learnt about Complex types like lists, tuples, Dictionaries.
But for a type like credit Card it doesn't belong to any of the above category
so we cannot apply the functions that are in built.
So inorder to define new methods that are useful in daily life applications,
we Create Classes to define these type of methods that are suitable

As like a list has many methods like append, clear, copy, count, insert etc.
We are going to create a new type of class and define its own methods to work with.

Point is the class we are going to create. the methods are get_distance, move, draw etc.
