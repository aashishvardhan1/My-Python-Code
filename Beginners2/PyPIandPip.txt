All about PyPI aka Python Package Index
Pip is command to install or uninstall a Package from PyPI Website.

PyPI is large website where python developers post their work to make usable to us.
We can directly install the python package and use it as a built-in package like random/pylib

To install them you need to see the code line in the PyPI website and then type out that code on
the terminal of Pycharm/ Your IDE.
Then immediately the package would be installed. So, now the package ready for our usage.
